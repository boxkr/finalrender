npm run build
  Bundles the app into static files for production.

npm test

npm run eject
  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:
  cd panada-express
  npm start

The index.js initially loads App.js
The App.js declares different pages & loads each of the components
Other .js files are components of HTML that should be loaded
