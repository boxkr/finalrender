AGENDA:

    -WHERE ARE WE AT
    -OVERVIEW


KEEGAN:

    -Looking at ways to speed up the manager reports. Excess report used to run in 1.5 minutes, now runs in 15 seconds but want it faster
    -Dr. Thomas recommended using SQL itself to better make the query instead of doing more work outside of it

DEREK:

    -Finished refactoring where we're only using one entree and side component
    -Will be doing POST request to hook up final order to order history


WILLIAM:

    -Still working on OAUTH, I realized I should be working with Brandon more closely than I thought.
    -May not need OAUTH for logging in, rather just use database


BRANDON:

    -Still working on translate and google maps api integration, figuring out OAUTH portin.
    -Figured out how to embed a map, need to figure out how to pinpoint


OVERVIEW:

    Things are going good, OAUTH and api integration is proving to be kind of difficult but it's not a huge issue yet.
